### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New package `ea_stress/` alongside existing `engine/`, `modules/`, `reports/`
- Skills remain unchanged until Phase 7 (Compatibility Shim)
- Optimization loop is ONE skill (/optimization-loop), not separate Steps 6-8B
